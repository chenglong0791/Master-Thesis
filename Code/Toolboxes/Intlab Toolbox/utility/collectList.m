%COLLECTLIST  Union of overlapping boxes
%
%   List = collectList(List,thr)  
%
%Parameters:
%   List    input List
%   thr     threshold for overlapping, for thr=0.0 all overlapping boxes
%           will be unified, thr=1.0 requires a 100% overlapping.
%
%The list of undecided boxes produced by verifynlssall, verifyglobalmin or
%by verifyconstraintglobalmin may be large. Union of overlapping boxes
%saves memory, however, also gives away information. 
%Moreover, collecting may be slow for many input boxes.
%
%For List being an N x K array of intervals, the output covers the union of
%boxes but collecting overlapping boxes into one box. 
%
%The process is repeated so that the union of a pair of boxes may become
%large enough to swallow the next box.
%
%As an example consider
%
%   X1 = [ infsup(0.2,1.2) infsup( 0 , 1 ) infsup(0.9,2.2)
%          infsup( 1 , 3 ) infsup(0.2,3.2) infsup( 0 , 3 ) ];
%   X2 = [ infsup( 2 , 4 ) infsup(2.4,3.8) infsup(2.5,4.2)
%          infsup(1.9, 5 ) infsup(1.7,3.7) infsup(1.6, 4 ) ];
%   X = [ X1 X2 ];
%   close all
%   subplot(1,4,1);
%   plotintval(X)
%   for index=1:3
%     subplot(1,4,index+1)
%     plotintval(collectList(X,1-.3*index))
