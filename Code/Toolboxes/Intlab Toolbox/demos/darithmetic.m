%% Interval arithmetic in INTLAB
%

%% Redefinition of the interval arithmetic
% With Version 6 of INTLAB I redefined the interval arithmetic in INTLAB. Formerly,
% the empty set was represented by NaN. It turned out that a consistent definition
% of all interval operations avoiding NaN-results slows down EVERY interval operation
% in INTLAB. Therefore I choose to interpret a NaN-component as "no information".
%
% Although infinity- or NaN-components are usually rare, taking care of them slows
% down simpe operations by up to a factor 3. I found this hardly acceptable.
%
% Most users won't recognize any change. I recommend to visit the demo "dintval" 
% before continuing with this demo.                  

%% Definition of interval arithmetic
% If an interval component has value NaN, it does not mean that component empty 
% but rather no information is available on that component. For example,

     format compact short infsup
     X = [ infsup(3,inf) ; infsup(-1,2) ; inf]
     Y = 0./X
     
%% 
% has one component "NaN" due to the division 0/0. Any operation with this
% component will result in a "NaN" component, such as

     contains_0 = in(0,Y)
     intersect( infsup(-1,4) , Y )

%% Input out of range for real standard functions
% If for real standard functions part of the input is out of range, the result
% of the corresponding component will be NaN:

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnNaN')
     X = [ infsup(-2,9) ; infsup(0,4) ]
     Y = sqrt(X)

%% How to use the NaN-mode?
% The default NaN-mode can be used without any precautions. If during the computation of
% a result all operations are well-defined, the computed result is a true inclusion of the
% correct result.
%
% If during the computation the input of some operation was out-of-range, the computed
% result will be NaN. More precisely, the corresponding components will be NaN, as in

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnNaN')
     X = intval(-1:1)
     Y = log(X)
     
%%
% The real standard functions can be switched automatically to their complex
% pendant as follows:

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnWarn')
     X = [ infsup(2,3) infsup(-1,4) ]
     midrad(sqrt(X))
     
%%
% The warning may be suppressed using "intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnAuto')".

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnAuto')
     X = [ infsup(2,3) infsup(-1,4) ]
     midrad(sqrt(X))

%%
% And finally the message when changing the mode may be suppressed using 
% "intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnAuto',0)".

     intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnAuto',0)
     X = [ infsup(2,3) infsup(-1,4) ]
     midrad(sqrt(X))

%% The empty set
% There is no explicit representation of the empty set. This is a necessary compromise. 
% Since NaN is interpreted as Not-an-Interval, another representation of the 
% empty set would have been necessary, slowing down again EVERY operation.
%
% However, the only operation in the NaN-mode, the result of which may be the empty
% set is intersection. However, numerous case distinctions in many programs would have
% been necessary to distinguish between NaN and the empty set - whatever the representation
% of the latter may be. All operations would be slowed down by that. Maybe that is not 
% worth it. 
%
% Consider 
 
   A = infsup( [1 2;-2 3;0 2] , [2 3;1 4;3 5] )
   res = intersect(A(:,1),A(:,2))
   
%%
% How to decide that the intersection of A(2,1) and A(2,2) is truely empty
% and not the consequence of some NaN-component? This is solved as follows:
 
   [e,res] = emptyintersect(A(:,1),A(:,2))
   
%%
% Now e(2)=1 indicates that indeed the intersection is empty; a zero
% component in e corresponds to non-empty intersection.
