%% DEMOINTLAB_LARGER  Some larger examples with INTLAB
% Following are some larger examples using INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for Reliable Computing. 
% All computations are on my 3.0 GHz Laptop using Matlab R2017a under Windows.
%
%% Dense linear systems
% The following generates a dense linear system with n=5000 unknowns randomly 
% with solution approximately all 1's.
% Since random matrices are generally well-conditioned, this is no real
% challenge concerning verification of the result. 
%
% Here and in the following we display the computing time for the Matlab 
% built-in solver and for our verification routines. Note that this compares
% apples with oranges: the results of the verification routine are
% mathematically proved to be correct, including all rounding errors and
% the proof of non-singularity of the input matrix, wheras approximations
% are sometimes not correct, even without warning (see e.g. the section
% "Larger least squares problems").
%
% Following the computing time for
% the Matlab solver A\b and for the verification INTLAB algorithm verifylss, 
% some components of the solution as well as the minimum and median number 
% of correct digits is displayed.
