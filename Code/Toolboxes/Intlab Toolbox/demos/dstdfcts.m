%% DEMOSTDFCTS  Interval standard functions in INTLAB
%

%%
% As explained in "DEMOINTVAL", standard functions with interval argument
% compute an inclusion of the true function value or the true function
% range.

%% Input arguments I
% 
% Special care is necessary if an input argument is not a floating-point
% number. For example,

format long _
x = intval([2.5 -0.3]);
y = erf(x)

%%
% computes the true range of the error function erf(2.5), but not
% necessarily of erf(-0.3). To obtain true results use

x = intval('2.5 -0.3');
y = erf(x)

%%
% Note that intval converts a character string representing a vector
% always into a column vector. 
% To see the accuracy of the result, the infsup-notation may be used:

infsup(y)
relerr(y)

%% Input arguments II
% Similarly, the range of a function is included by

x = intval('[2.5,2.500001]')
y = erf(x)

%%
% Note that the large diameter of the output is due to the large diameter
% of the input.
      
%% Accuracy of standard functions
% The complementary error function erfc(x) is defined by 1-erf(x). It
% rapidly approximates 1 for larger x. In this case erfc(x) is much more
% accurate than 1-erf(x).

x = intval(5);
y1 = erfc(x)
y2 = 1 - erf(x)
infsup([y1;y2])

%%
% Sometimes the built-in standard functions are not very accurate:

x = linspace(1+1e-14,1+1e-5,100000);
y = acoth(x); Y = acoth(intval(x));
close, semilogy( x,abs((y-Y.mid)./(y+Y.mid)), x,relerr(Y) )

%% Nonlinear equations involving standard functions I
% The zero of a nonlinear function may be approximated by some Newton
% procedure. Consider

x = linspace(0,10);
f = @(x) erf(x)-sin(x)
close
plot(x,f(x),x,0*x)

%%
% The graph shows the function erf(x)-sin(x) between 0 and 10. Besides the
% obvious root zero there seem to be two small roots near 1 and 2, and
% mathematically it follows that there must be two roots near 8. 
%
% To approximate the roots, a Newton procedure may be used. For example

x = 1;
for i=1:5
  y = f(gradientinit(x));
  x = x - y.x/y.dx
end

%% Inclusion of the solution of nonlinear systems with standard functions
% As expected, the iteration converges very rapidly. The final value is a
% very good approximation of a root of f, and an inclusion is computed by

Y = verifynlss(f,x)

%% The range of a function and overestimation
% The computed inclusion of the range of a function is a true estimate, but
% may be not sharp:

x = infsup(0,1);
yinf = f(x)

%%
% The inclusion can be improved using affine interval arithmetic:

yaff = f(affari(x))

%% Nonlinear equations involving standard functions II
% More interesting is the root cluster near x=8. An attempt to compute
% inclusions fails:

Y1 = verifynlss(f,7.5)
Y2 = verifynlss(f,8.5)

%%
% The reason is that numerically this is a double zero because erf(8) is
% very close to 1, as can be checked by erfc(8) = 1-erf(8) :

y = erfc(intval(8))

%%
% At least an inclusion of the extremum of f near 8 can be computed.
% Clearly it must be near to 2.5*pi.

Y = verifylocalmin(f,8)
y = 2.5*pi

%%
% For interval enthusiasts an inclusion of 2.5*pi can be computed as well.
% Note, however, that this is only close to the extremum.

y1 = 2.5*intval('pi')

%% Verification of two roots
% In the previous example, the function f has a nearly double root. It can
% be shown that a perturbed function g has a true double root:

Y = verifynlss2(f,8);
root = Y(1)
perturbation = Y(2)

%%
% That shows that the function g(x) := f(x)-e with e included in the
% computed perturbation has a double root contained in Y(1).

%% Accuracy of the gamma function I
% Usually, Matlab standard functions produce very accurate approximations.
% For example,

x = pi
y = gamma(pi)
Y = gamma(intval('pi'))

%%
% Here  Y is a true inclusion of the value of the gamma function at
% the transcendental number pi: X=intval('pi') is an inclusion of the
% mathematical 
% pi, and the gamma function for an interval argument produces an inclusion
% of all values, in particular for the transcendental number pi.

%% Accuracy of the gamma function II
% For negative arguments something strange happens in Matlab. Consider

x1 = -171.5;
x2 = -172.5;
y1 = gamma(x1)
y2 = gamma(x2)

%%
% Regardless of the fact that for larger negative argument the gamma
% function is very small in absolute value, this cannot be true because the
% gamma function changes the sign when passing a negative integer:

 close
 axis([-5 5 -10 10])
 hold on
 for k=-5:5
   x = linspace(k,k+1,10000); 
   plot(x,gamma(x))
 end
 plot([-5 5],[0 0],':',[0 0],[-10 10],'b:')
 hold off

%%
% The true values of the gamma function at x1=-171.5 and x2=-172.5 are indeed very
% small:

Y1 = gamma(intval(x1))
Y2 = gamma(intval(x2))

%% Accuracy of the gamma function III
% However, for negative values near integers, that is near
% poles, Matlab's built-in gamma function is sometimes very inaccurate. For
% some reason this happens only right to negative integers. For example,

e = 2^(-40);
x = [-1-e -1+e];
gamma(x)
gamma(intval(x))

%%
% In this case the input arguments -1+/-e are exactly representable
% floating-point numers. For the example this is not important because both
% the Matlab's approximate gamma function and INTLAB's verified gamma
% function use the same input.
%
% As can be seen only 4 digits are correct for the second argument. Getting
% closer to the right of negative integers makes things worse:

x = succ(-1);
gamma(x)
gamma(intval(x))

%%
% Now the approximate value has no correct digit. If a symbolic toolbox is
% available, the accuracy of INTLAB's gamma function can be checked:

digits(100)
vpa( gamma(sym(x,'f')) )

%% Inverse gamma function
% Using automatic differentiation, values of the inverse gamma function are
% easily approximated. For example, compute x such that gamma(x)=3:

x = 4;
for i=1:5
    y = gamma(gradientinit(x)) - 3;
    x = x - y.x/y.dx
end

%%
% This value is approximate, the true value can be verified as follows:

X = verifynlss(@(x) gamma(x)-3 , 4)

%% Minimum of the gamma function
% Similarly, the minimum on the real axis of the gamma function is enclosed
% by

mu = verifylocalmin(@gamma,2)
