%% DEMOGRADIENT  Short demonstration of gradients
%

%% Some sample applications of the gradient toolbox
% The gradient toolbox implements automatic differentiation in forward mode. 
%

%% Initialization of gradients
% In order to use automatic differentiation, the independent variables need
% to be identified and values have to be assigned. This is performed by
% the function "gradientinit". For example                            

format compact short _
u = gradientinit([ -3.1 ; 4e-3 ])

%%
% The total size of the input is the number of independent variables,   
% in the example 2, hence u represents a column vector of length 2 and
% defines two independent variables u(1) and u(2) with gradients [1 0]
% and [0 1], respectively.

%% Operations between gradients
% If at least one operand is of type gradient, operations are executed as 
% gradient operations.
% For example,                                                          

x = gradientinit(3.5);  
y = exp(3*x-sqrt(x))

%%
% For f(x):=exp(3*x-sqrt(x)), the result y contains in y.x the function value f(3.5)
% and in y.dx the derivative f'(3.5):
% 

y.x, y.dx

%% Complex arguments
% When evaluating the expression for another argument, use the same
% statement as before with new values.                                                 

x = gradientinit(-3.5+.2i);  
y = exp(3*x-sqrt(x))

%% Access to the gradient
% The principle works for functions in several unknowns the same way. Define, for
% example, the following function from R^3->R^3 :

f = @(x)( [ -2*x(1)*x(2)+4*x(3)^2 ; sin(x(2))/sqrt(pi-x(1)) ; atan(x(2)-x(3)) ] )
f([1.5;-1;0.7])

%%
% then the function value and gradient at [1.5;-1;0.7] is computed by

y = f(gradientinit([1.5;-1;0.7]))

%%
% where y.x contains the function value and y.dx the gradient, which is
% in this case the Jacobian. The gradient with respect the third unknown 
% x(3), for example, can be accessed by

y.dx(3,:)

%%
% However, it is recommended to use

y(3).dx

%%
% that is not to access the components of the gradient (Jacobian) but the
% gradient of the component. The advantage is visible when redefining the input function
% as a row vector:

f = @(x)( [ -2*x(1)*x(2)+4*x(3)^2  sin(x(2))/sqrt(pi-x(1))  atan(x(2)-x(3)) ] )
f([1.5;-1;0.7])

%%
% Then the "Jacobian" is a three-dimensional array
% because the gradient is always stored in the "next" dimension: 

y = f(gradientinit([1.5;-1;0.7]))

%%
% It is problematic to access the components of y.dx, while accessing the 
% gradient of the component works as expected:

y(3).dx

%% The inverse Gamma function
% We may want to calculate the inverse Gamma function using INTLAB's 
% verified Gamma function. For example, compute u such that gamma(u) = 100. 
% Consider the following simple Newton procedure with starting value u=5.

format long
u = gradientinit(5);
uold = u;
k = 0;
while abs(u.x-uold.x) > 1e-12*abs(u.x) | k < 1
  uold = u;
  k = k+1;
  y = gamma(u) - 100;
  u = u - y.x/y.dx;
end
k
u.x
gamma(u.x)


%% The inverse Gamma function with complex arguments
% Neither Matlab nor INTLAB provide the Gamma function for complex
% arguments. However, we may use an approximation by Stirling's formula.
% For u -> inf,                    
%

%   function y = g(u)

%%
% Note however that the approximation by Stirling's formula is of limited
% accuracy. The last line, a verified inclusion by INTLAB's Gamma function,
% indicates about 6 to 11 correct figures, depending on the magnitude of
% the argument.
%
% Using Stirling's formula we may search u with g(u) = 100 + 100i. 
% We use the same starting value u=5.

%%
% Due to approximation error in Stirling's formula, about six figures are correct.

%% Automatic differentiation with several unknowns
% Automatic differentiation with several unknowns works the same way.  
% Consider the following example by Broyden:
%                                                                             
%                               .5*sin(x1*x2) - x2/(4*pi) - x1/2  =  0         
% (1-1/(4*pi))*(exp(2*x1)-exp(1)) + exp(1)*x2/pi - 2*exp(1)*x1 )  =  0         
%                                                                              
% with initial approximation [ .6 ; 3 ] and one solution [ .5 ; pi ].           
% The following inline function evaluates Broyden's function.

f = @(x) ( [ .5*sin(x(1)*x(2)) - x(2)/(4*pi) - x(1)/2 ; ...
             (1-1/(4*pi))*(exp(2*x(1))-exp(1)) + exp(1)*x(2)/pi - 2*exp(1)*x(1) ] )

%% Solution of a nonlinear system
% The nonlinear system defined by Broyden's function is solved by Newton's procedure as follows:                                                                           

 x = gradientinit([ .6 ; 3 ]);
 for i=1:5
  y = f(x);
  x = x - y.dx\y.x;
 end
 x

%%                                                             
% For simplicity, we omitted the stopping criterion (see above).   
% Here, y.dx is the Jacobian, y.x the function value at x.x, and -y.dx\y.x  
% is the correction obtained by the (approximate) solution of a linear system.                
%                                                                           

%% Verified solution of the nonlinear system
% For verified solution of the nonlinear system, we need a correct definition  
% of the function. The main point is to make sure that a function evaluation with
% interval argument computes an inclusion of the function value. So first the
% transcendental number pi has to be replaced by an interval containing pi:

cPi = intval('pi')

%%
% Second, Broyden's function contains exp(1), which would be computed in pure
% floating-point without extra care. This can be cured using exp(intval(1)).
%
% However, a new problem arises. 
% When replacing "pi" in the function by "cPi" and 1 by intval(1), the function is       
% _always_ evaluated in interval arithmetic; a pure floating point iteration     
% is no longer possible. 
%
% To solve this problem, we have to know the type of     
% the incoming unknown "x". If "x" is double, replace "cPi" and intval(1) by its midpoint,   
% if "x" is an interval, use "cPi" and intval(1) as is. This is done as follows.             
%                                                                               
%  function  y = f(x)                                                           
%    y = x;
%    c1 = typeadj( 1 , typeof(x) );
%    cpi = typeadj( midrad(3.14159265358979323,1e-16) , typeof(x) );
%    y(1) = .5*sin(x(1)*x(2)) - x(2)/(4*cpi) - x(1)/2;
%    y(2) = (1-1/(4*cpi))*(exp(2*x(1))-exp(c1)) + exp(c1)*x(2)/cpi - 2*exp(c1)*x(1);
%                                                                               
% This code is implemented in the function Broyden.m .

%% Real and interval function evaluation
% Consider the following two function evaluations. First, f(x) is evaluated
% for real argument:

x = [ .6 ; 3 ];  
Broyden(x)

%% 
% Second, f(x) is evaluated with interval argument:

format _
x = [intval('.6') ; 3 ] 
y = Broyden(x)

%%
% The mathematical statement is the following. First, x is an interval vector
% such that x(1) is an inclusion of 0.6 and x(2)=3. Second, cPi is an interval
% containg the transcendental number pi. Third, y is an interval vector 
% containing the exact value of Broyden's function evaluated at [ .6 ; 3 ].

%% Gradient function evaluation using ordinary intervals
% Finally, we may define the interval x to be of type gradient:

x = gradientinit([intval('.6') ; 3 ])
Y = Broyden(x)

%%
% The mathematical statement is that Y is an interval vector such that Y.x
% contains the exact value of Broyden's function evaluated at [ .6 ; 3 ], and
% Y.dx is an interval matrix containing the Jacobian of Broyden's function
% evaluated at [ .6 ; 3 ].
                                                                          
%% Gradient function evaluation using affine intervals
% We may use affine arithmetic in gradient evaluations as well, for details
% see the affari demo:

x = gradientinit([affari(.6) ; 3 ])
Y = Broyden(x)

%% Verified solution of the nonlinear system with Broyden's function
% The nonlinear system with Broyden's function and the given starting value
% [ .6 ; 3 ] can be solved with verification by         

Y = verifynlss(@Broyden,[ .6 ; 3 ])
                               
%%
% The first parameter gives the name of the function such that Broyden(x) 
% evaluates the function at "x". The result vector Y is verified to contain
% a real vector xhat such that f(xhat)=0. This solution X of the nonlinear system
% is proved to be unique within Y. This statement is mathematically true,
% it is taken care of all procedural, approximation and rounding errors. 
%
% It follows that an inclusion is not possible if roots are very close
% together or multiple:
% Since uniqueness of the root is proved, an inclusion is only possible if roots
% can be separated. An escape of that is described in DEMOSLOPE.

%% All roots of Broyden's function
% The root [ 0.5 ; pi ] is mentioned in the literature, however, there are
% many more roots. For example, there are seven roots in the box [-10,10]^2

format short
L = verifynlssall(@Broyden,infsup(-10,10)*ones(2,1))

%%
% For more details, please visit the demo on global routines by demo toolbox intlab .

%% Verified solution of a nonlinear system with sparse gradients
% Up to now we considered only toy examples to explain how the nonlinear
% system solver works. For a larger example consider the following example
% proposed by Abbot and Brent, which is implemented in the function test.
%

%%
%  function y = test(x);
%  % Abbot/Brent     3 y" y + y'^2 = 0;    y(0)=0; y(1)=20;
%  % approximation   10*ones(n,1)
%  % solution        20*x^.75
%    y = x;
%    n = length(x); v=2:n-1;
%    y(1) = 3*x(1)*(x(2)-2*x(1)) + x(2)*x(2)/4;
%    y(v) = 3*x(v).*(x(v+1)-2*x(v)+x(v-1)) + (x(v+1)-x(v-1)).^2/4;
%    y(n) = 3*x(n).*(20-2*x(n)+x(n-1)) + (20-x(n-1)).^2/4;
%
% An inclusion of the solution for 1000 unknowns is computed by
%

format short
sparsegradient(50)
n = 1000; 
tic
x = verifynlss(@test,10*ones(n,1)); 
toc
max(relerr(x))

%% Verified solution of a nonlinear system with full gradients
% Here we specified that gradients with 50 unknowns and more are stored
% in sparse mode. This is the default when calling "sparsegradient". 
%
% Forcing gradients to use full storage results in a significantly increase
% of computing time. 

sparsegradient(inf)
n = 1000; 
tic
x = verifynlss(@test,10*ones(n,1)); 
toc
max(relerr(x))
 
%% Verified solution of a nonlinear system with 10,000 unknowns
% Note that the inclusion is of high accuracy. The results for a larger
% nonlinear system with 10,000 unknowns is as follows.
 
sparsegradient(0)
n = 10000; 
tic
x = verifynlss(@test,10*ones(n,1)); 
toc
max(relerr(x))


%% Non-differentiable functions
% The given function need not be differentiable everywhere. Consider, for example,

f = inline('abs(x)')
f(gradientinit(infsup(-.1,2)))

%% Verified solution of non-differentiable functions 
% The inclusion of a root is searched for near the given approximation. Consider

f = vectorize(inline('x*sinh(x)-3*exp(abs(x)-.5)+x*cos(x+1)+2*cosh(x)'))
close
x=linspace(-1,2.3);
plot(x,f(x),x,0*x)

%%
% It seems there are three roots. Indeed,

format long
verifynlss(f,-.5)
verifynlss(f,.5)
verifynlss(f,2)

%%
% there are three roots, and the inlcusions are of high accuracy. One can
% also calculate an inclusion of multiple roots. Since the problem is ill-posed,
% it has to be regularized. Consider

X = verifynlss2(@(x)(sin(x)-1),1.5)

%%
% It is proved that there exists some parameter e in X(2) such that the function 
% g(x):=f(x)-e has a truely double root in X(1). Note the accuracy of the inclusions.
% It looks like the inclusion of e is a true zero. However, this is due to the "_"-format:
% add +/-1 to the last visible digit produces a valid inclusion:

format long e infsup
X

%%
% The function "verifynlss2" is applicable to multivariate functions as well.
