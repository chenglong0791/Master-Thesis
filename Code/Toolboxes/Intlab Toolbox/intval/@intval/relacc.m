function res = relacc(x)
%RELACC       Relative accuracy of an interval in decimal digits
%
%   res = relacc(x)   for interval input x
%
%Relative accuracy as defined in
%  S.M. Rump: The relative accuracy of an interval, to appear
%In numerical analysis we have the well-accepted rule of thumb that a computed approximation 
%  of a linear system with condition number 10^k has roughly 16-k correct digits.
%The purpose of relacc is to check this rule of thumb for interval inclusions. That means 
%  a good verification algorithm produces an inclusion x with relacc(x) roughly of size 16-k.
%
%Note that r(i)=relacc(x(i)) for r=relacc(x) is only true for normed vector x, more precisely,
%  for max(rad(x)+mig(x))==1. For real x this means max(abs(inf(x))+abs(sup(x)))==1.
%
%Careful: relacc produces full output for sparse x; use relacc(nonzeros(x)) for sparse input
