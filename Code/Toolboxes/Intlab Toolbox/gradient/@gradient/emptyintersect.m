function [empty,a] = emptyintersect(a,b)
%EMPTYINTERSECT    Compute intersection and check for empty components
%
%   [empty,c] = emptyintersect(a,b)
%
%Result c is that of intersect(a,b), and 
%  empty(i) = 1     intersection of a(i) and b(i) is empty
%                     or at least one of a(i) and b(i) is NaN
%             0     intersection of a(i) and b(i) is not empty
%
%Intersection is taken for a.x and b.x part, derivatives remain unchanged.
%Input a and b must be both real or both complex
